## Original assets

- `assets/skins/r4/sfx/*.wav`: synthesised for this project by `tools/gen_sfx.py`
  (sine sweeps with a short envelope). No recorded or game audio.
- Both skins use only procedural shapes, colours and the Lato fonts. No game
  art, logos or screen captures are included. A player may point a skin at
  their own files (`$exe/...`, `"optional": true`), which are never shipped.
